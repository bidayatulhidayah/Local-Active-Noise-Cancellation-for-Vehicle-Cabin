# Local-Active-Noise-Cancellation-for-Vehicle-Cabin

## Introduction 

This project focuses on designing an **Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) system** to reduce unwanted engine noise in vehicle cabins, creating a quieter and more comfortable environment. The system uses **adaptive algorithms** to generate an anti-noise signal that cancels out unwanted sound through **destructive interference**.  

Key aspects of this research include:  
- **Modeling sound wave behavior** using **MATLAB** and **COMSOL Multiphysics**  
- **Developing a feedforward ANC system** with real-time **adaptive control**  
- **Implementing and testing** on **LabVIEW** with a **CompactRIO controller**  

Tests showed effective noise reduction at **200 Hz and 63.47 Hz**, achieving **6.02 dB and 3.52 dB attenuation**, respectively. Future improvements will explore **Recursive Least Squares (RLS)** and **Neural Network-based algorithms** to enhance adaptability.
